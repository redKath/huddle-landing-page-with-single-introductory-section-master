### What I learned

This is my second Frontend Mentor Challenge. I learned how to use media queries and make a responsive web design. I also learned how about the hover and active states. At first I was just planning to do the hover state for the buttons and the icons, but without the active state they are not responsive and I think that's not good for the user experience since something should happen when they click the icons and buttons. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS :hover Selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp) - This helped me for making the hover effect for the buttons and icons. There are simple examples here.
- [Using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) - This is an amazing article from MDN which helped me  understand media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
